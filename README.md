# rmyknife

The goal of rmyknife is to provide a centralized place for R functions that I often use but that do not belong to a more specialized package yet.
This package will probably be pretty messy.

## Installation

You can install the github version of rmyknife with:

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("paulklemm/rmyknife")
```
